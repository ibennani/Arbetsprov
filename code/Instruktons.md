Ilias Bennani - B3IT
====================

I have tried to complete this test as good as I can.
If there is something i've missed or if there's something else you want me to to, please let me know and I will fix that asap. 


How to install and run
----------------------

In order to make this as simple as possible, no local modules, no grunt nor sass etc is used.
All the libraries (Angular, Bootstrap, Jquery) are fetched by using CDN's

1. Be sure to have an HTTP-server of your choise running and set the "public" directory as your www-root.
2. Run the index.html
3. Enjoy my work. *smile*


A few questions concerning the instructions
-------------------------------------------
1. There is a difference in the background colors of the input box in the two UI examples.

2. When looking at the search result UI, only one line is highlighted. On a desktop, this must be "hover", but what does this mean on a mobile device? 

3. What does the red square at the very right of the selected row do? There is no corresponding UX directive.

4. The provided icon "search.svg" looks a bit different than the magnifying glass in the UI example. It looks like you want me to use Font Awsome, and so I did.
